        Housing and poverty

      <p class="govuk-body">Rises in housing have increased the cost of living, particularly for people in poverty. Few people, when they think about it, blame personal choice as the sole cause of poverty. They understand that the quality of local jobs, the cost of housing, and welfare reforms matter too.</p>

        Summary
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Government housing support helps to reduce poverty and its effects, but it is not always enough. Rising housing costs can trap people in poverty, unable to move for work or pay their rent without support.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">To use housing to solve UK poverty we must:</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Increase the housing supply to 200,000 units a year by 2040.</li>
        <li>Make sure the proportion of social rented housing does not decrease.</li>
        <li>Stop social rents from rising to match private rents.</li>
        <li>Bring forward the Renters’ Reform Bill and end No Fault evictions.</li>
